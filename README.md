# TriLUG Membership Registration

This is a simple flow to enable us to get away from using paper forms and a bunch of
manual transcription in order to register new members.

It is intended to work like this:
   1 Prospective member clicks on the 'Request Membership' link on the TriLUG front page.
   1 The next time they attend a meeting, they speak to a SC member to complete the
     process.
   1 The SC member visits steering.trilug.org and clicks on 'Process Membership Requests'.
   1 The SC member selects 'Register' on the prospect's request, and submits.
   1 The SC member logs in to pilot and creates the shell account (instructions are on
     the page above).
   1 The SC member fills out a membership card and gives it to the new member.
